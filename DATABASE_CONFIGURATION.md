# GhotokBari Database Configuration Guide

## Production Database Security

This guide ensures your GhotokBari matrimonial system maintains a secure, persistent connection to your Neon PostgreSQL database without unexpected fallbacks to temporary storage.

## ‚úÖ Current Status

- **Database**: Connected to Neon PostgreSQL
- **Storage Type**: Persistent database storage
- **Environment**: DATABASE_URL configured securely
- **Safety**: Production-grade connection safeguards active

## üîí Security Features Implemented

### 1. Production Safety Checks
- **No Memory Fallback in Production**: Application will refuse to start if DATABASE_URL is missing in production
- **Connection Validation**: Validates proper PostgreSQL connection string format
- **Retry Logic**: Attempts database connection up to 3 times with 2-second delays
- **Health Monitoring**: Database health endpoint available at `/api/health/database`

### 2. Enhanced Connection Pool
- **Connection Limits**: Maximum 20 concurrent connections
- **Timeout Protection**: 10-second connection timeout
- **Keep-Alive**: Maintains stable connections
- **Idle Management**: 30-second idle timeout prevents resource waste

### 3. Environment-Specific Behavior
- **Development**: Falls back to memory storage with warnings if database unavailable
- **Production**: **NEVER** falls back to memory storage - application stops if database fails

## üõ°Ô∏è Neon PostgreSQL Optimization

### Auto-Suspend Configuration
To prevent unexpected database disconnections, consider these Neon settings:

1. **Increase Auto-Suspend Delay**:
   - Go to your Neon dashboard
   - Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Compute
   - Set auto-suspend delay to 5-10 minutes (or disable for critical applications)

2. **Monitor Connection Pool**:
   - Current pool size: 20 connections
   - Idle timeout: 30 seconds
   - Connection timeout: 10 seconds

### Connection String Security
Your DATABASE_URL is stored as an environment variable and includes:
- ‚úÖ Proper format validation
- ‚úÖ Automatic quote cleaning
- ‚úÖ SSL mode enforcement
- ‚úÖ Connection timeout protection

## üîç Monitoring & Health Checks

### Database Health Endpoint
```
GET /api/health/database
```

Response (when healthy):
```json
{
  "status": "healthy",
  "storageType": "PostgreSQL",
  "timestamp": "2025-07-15T18:30:00.000Z",
  "environment": "production"
}
```

### Connection Monitoring
The application logs connection attempts and provides detailed feedback:
- Connection success/failure messages
- Retry attempt notifications
- Production vs development mode indicators

## üö® Production Deployment Checklist

Before deploying to production, ensure:

- [ ] DATABASE_URL is set in environment variables
- [ ] Database_URL format is valid PostgreSQL connection string
- [ ] Neon database is accessible from your deployment environment
- [ ] Auto-suspend delay is configured appropriately
- [ ] NODE_ENV is set to 'production'
- [ ] Database migrations have been applied (`npx drizzle-kit push`)

## üîß Troubleshooting

### Common Issues and Solutions

1. **"Database connection failed in production"**
   - Verify DATABASE_URL is set correctly
   - Check Neon database status
   - Ensure SSL mode is enabled in connection string

2. **"Invalid DATABASE_URL format"**
   - Ensure connection string starts with `postgresql://` or `postgres://`
   - Remove any extra quotes or spaces

3. **Connection timeouts**
   - Check network connectivity to Neon
   - Verify connection pool settings
   - Monitor auto-suspend settings

### Emergency Recovery
If database connection fails in production:
1. Check Neon dashboard for database status
2. Verify DATABASE_URL environment variable
3. Review application logs for specific error messages
4. Use health endpoint to diagnose connection issues

## üìä Performance Optimization

### Current Settings
- **Max Connections**: 20 (suitable for most applications)
- **Idle Timeout**: 30 seconds (prevents resource waste)
- **Connection Timeout**: 10 seconds (prevents hanging)
- **Keep-Alive**: Enabled (maintains stable connections)

### Neon-Specific Optimizations
- WebSocket constructor configured for serverless
- Connection pooling optimized for Neon's architecture
- Automatic connection retry with exponential backoff

## üîÑ Maintenance

### Regular Checks
- Monitor database health endpoint weekly
- Review connection pool metrics
- Check Neon dashboard for performance insights
- Verify auto-suspend settings remain appropriate

### Updates
- Keep Neon client libraries updated
- Monitor for connection pool optimizations
- Review and adjust timeout settings as needed

**Security Note**: This configuration ensures your matrimonial data remains permanently stored and accessible while preventing any accidental data loss through memory storage fallbacks.
