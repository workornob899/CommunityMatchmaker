Hi, thanks again for your great work so far!

I just need a few final adjustments to the Profile Section so it fully matches my original requirements. Please see the updated instructions below:

üìç Profile Section ‚Äì Final Requirements:
1. Filtering & Search:
At the top of the Profile Section, include filtering options:

Filter by: Date, Gender, Profession, Birth Year, Height, Age

Include a Search button next to the filters

When clicked, this should display the filtered results below

2. Profile Display Layout:
Profiles should appear as large cards/boxes, not in a table

Each card should contain:

Left side: Profile picture

Right side: Profile details ‚Äì Name, Gender, Age, Profession, Height, etc.

Bottom right: A small Download button for the profile‚Äôs document

Layout: Show 2 profiles per row, with proper spacing

Each profile box should have a soft shadow for a premium look

Style and colors must match the overall site theme and logo

3. Data Flow:
When I add a profile using the ‚ÄúAdd Profile‚Äù button (top right corner), it should automatically be displayed in the Profile Section below

That Profile Section becomes the main view for all added profiles with filter/search support

üñ±Ô∏è 4. Profile Card Click ‚Äì Popup Modal:
When a user clicks on any profile card, a centered modal popup should appear

The background should blur while the popup is active (glassmorphism effect or soft blur)

The modal should look modern and smooth (rounded corners, clean UI)

‚úÖ Modal Content:
Profile Picture (large)

Name

Gender

Age

Profession

Height

Download Button (for document)

Close Button (top-right or below)

üé® UI Notes:
The popup should include smooth animations (like fade-in and scale-up)

Background blur must not freeze the page ‚Äî it should just give a soft focus

All designs must be visually consistent with the rest of the application

This will fully complete the Profile Section to align with the original concept.
Let me know if you need the full script again or a design reference.

Thanks a lot for your continued effort!
