# Production Deployment Configuration

## Database Connection
✅ **External Neon PostgreSQL Database Configured**
- Database URL: `postgresql://neondb_owner:npg_Bud9Xf1bSQlv@ep-crimson-fire-ae7u8amr-pooler.c-2.us-east-2.aws.neon.tech/neondb?sslmode=require&channel_binding=require`
- Connection validation: Blocks app startup if database is unavailable in production
- No fallback to in-memory storage in production environment
- Schema will be applied automatically on first connection to working database

**Note**: The provided database URL may need to be updated with the correct endpoint once the database is properly provisioned.

## File Storage Configuration
✅ **Cloudinary Storage Implemented**
- Profile pictures stored on Cloudinary
- Documents stored on Cloudinary
- All file URLs are permanent Cloudinary URLs
